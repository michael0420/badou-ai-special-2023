## clustering algorithm
In the clustering algorithm, we mainly discussed the following contents:
* K-Means：Invoke the K-Means clustering algorithm interface provided by openCV to cluster image pixels.
* K-Means_athlete：A simple K-Means clustering algorithm is mainly used to demonstrate the effectiveness and effectiveness of K-Means clustering.
* K-Means_RGB：Set different cluster numbers to display the differences in pixel clustering of images caused by different cluster numbers.
* Hierarchical clustering：This is a simple hierarchical clustering project that mainly demonstrates the role of hierarchical clustering.
## Tips
In practical projects, we often use the K-Means algorithm for data clustering operations, even though there are many clustering algorithms in scientific research nowadays. You can learn about the following for yourself, but please don't forget that a high degree of matching between the data and the model is what we want.
