### This is my third assignment.
    In this project, the following aspects were mainly explained:
    * histogram
        * Grayscale image histogram
        * Color image histogram
    * Histogram equalization
    * noise
    * Salt and pepper noise
    * Gaussian noise
### Tips
1. When drawing grayscale image histograms, we have a method for drawing color image histograms. You can find it in the histogram.py file, and we used two methods to draw grayscale image histograms: "calcHist" and "Hist". Of course, I also provided the differences between the two methods at the end of the code. You can try reading them as they can help you better code.
2. I have provided sufficient comments in each code to help you understand the functionality of each code. I hope you can remember them for later use in the coding process.
